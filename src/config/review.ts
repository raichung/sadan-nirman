      "I've been here multiple times. The coffee itself is just average to me. The service is good (the people working are nice). The aesthetic is obviously what brings the place some fame. A little overpriced (even for NY). A very small cup for $6 where I feel like the price comes from the top rainbow foam decor , when I'm going to cover it anyways. If it's for an insta pic then it may be worth it?",

      "They really take pride in their espresso roast here and the staff is extremely knowledgeable on the subject. It’s also a GREAT place to do work although a table is no guarantee; you might have to wait for a bit. My almond milk cappuccino was very acidic at the end which wasn’t expected but I could still tell the bean was high quality. Their larger lattés they put in a tall glass cup which looks really really cool. Would definitely go again.",
